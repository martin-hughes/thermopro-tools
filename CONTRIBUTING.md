# Contributions

Please:

1. Contribute in any way you feel you can - issues, docs, code, questions. It's all good.
   * But bear in mind that I get to choose if something gets merged.
2. Be respectful - of everyone.

If you feel that something's wrong, then please flag it - publicly or privately. I'll endeavour to facilitate a
solution, even if it's me that's in the wrong.
