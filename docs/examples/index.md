# Example data flows

This directory contains a set of sample data flows as recorded by me whilst trying to reverse engineer the TP25.

* [Driven by the app](./driven-by-app.md) - A simple sample of the app controlling the thermometer, with a temperature
  left to drift up and down
* [Basic test flows](./basic-tests.md) - A set of very basic examples generated during early testing
