# 0x01 Initial Setup

## Description

Sent by the app as the first command.

Without it being sent, the thermometer will not accept any other command, nor will it automatically send temperature
notifications.

The exact details of the command and response data are unknown.

## Example

* Command: `01 09 7032e2c1799db4d1c7 b1`
* Response: `01 01 0a 0c`

## Command Format

```c
struct {
  uint8_t unknown[9];
}
```

There is some structure, as changing the value generated by the app may result in 0x30 notifications not being sent.

## Response Format

```c
struct {
  uint8_t unknown;
}
```
